Subject: [PATCH 234/241] x86/tlb: Drop the _GPL from the cpu_tlbstate export
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 1e5476815fd7f98b888e01a0f9522b63085f96c9 upstream.

The recent changes for PTI touch cpu_tlbstate from various tlb_flush
inlines. cpu_tlbstate is exported as GPL symbol, so this causes a
regression when building out of tree drivers for certain graphics cards.

Aside of that the export was wrong since it was introduced as it should
have been EXPORT_PER_CPU_SYMBOL_GPL().

Use the correct PER_CPU export and drop the _GPL to restore the previous
state which allows users to utilize the cards they payed for.

As always I'm really thrilled to make this kind of change to support the
#friends (or however the hot hashtag of today is spelled) from that closet
sauce graphics corp.
