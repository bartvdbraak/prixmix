Subject: [PATCH 064/231] x86/unwind: Make CONFIG_UNWINDER_ORC=y the default in
 kconfig for 64-bit
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

CVE-2017-5754

The ORC unwinder has been stable in testing so far.  Give it much wider
testing by making it the default in kconfig for x86_64.  It's not yet
supported for 32-bit, so leave frame pointers as the default there.
