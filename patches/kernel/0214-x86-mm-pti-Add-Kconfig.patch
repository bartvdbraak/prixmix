Subject: [PATCH 214/242] x86/mm/pti: Add Kconfig
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

CVE-2017-5754

Finally allow CONFIG_PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION to be enabled.

PARAVIRT generally requires that the kernel not manage its own page tables.
It also means that the hypervisor and kernel must agree wholeheartedly
about what format the page tables are in and what they contain.
PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION, unfortunately, changes the rules and they
can not be used together.

I've seen conflicting feedback from maintainers lately about whether they
want the Kconfig magic to go first or last in a patch series.  It's going
last here because the partially-applied series leads to kernels that can
not boot in a bunch of cases.  I did a run through the entire series with
CONFIG_PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION=y to look for build errors, though.

[ tglx: Removed SMP and !PARAVIRT dependencies as they not longer exist ]
